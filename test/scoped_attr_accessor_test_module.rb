  # attr_readers mixed in after the readers and another set after the
  # writers and accessors. This is so the test suite can check to make
  # sure that we stayed in public scope afterwards. A set of explicit
  # poke and peek public accessor methods allow the test suite to modify
  # and examine the contents of these private attributes.
